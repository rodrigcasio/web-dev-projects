<!--    key Tailwind CSS classes used definitions : 
    
    flex and flex-col
        flex: Activates flexbox layout, allowing easy alignment and distribution of child elements (the elements inside it) along a row or column
        flex-col: By default, arranges child elements vertically in a column layout, stacking them one below the other

    md:flex-row
        md:: A responsive prefix that targets medium screens (768px and larger)
        flex-row: Changes the flex container's layout from a column to a row on medium and larger screens, arranging child elements horizontally side by side

    w-full and md:w-1/4
        w-full: Sets the element's width to 100% of its parent container, making it full width on small screens
        md:w-1/4: On medium and larger screens, sets the element's width to 25% of the container, making it more compact and allowing for a horizontal layout

    p-4
        p-4: Adds padding of 1rem (16px) to all sides of the element, providing consistent spacing around the content and improving visual appeal

    min-h-screen
        Ensures the element's height is at least as tall as the viewport height, so the layout fills the screen even if the content inside is minimal

    bg-*
        bg-* classes are used to set background colors, such as bg-gray-100, which help distinguish different sections and improve the overall visual clarity of the layout
